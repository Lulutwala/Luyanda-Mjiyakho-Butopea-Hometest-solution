1.Before starting the project, I first created folders where I will store the solutions to the projects.
2.I then connected the project to my gitHub by creating a new repository on my GitHub desktop,this makes it easier to collaborate with other 
team members or for others to view the project solutions.
3.For this project solution, I choose to use python 3 which is the latest version of python.I will be using python version 3 which has built in library
 which allows SQLite to function effectively without any extra installations required.
4.After deciding to use python 3, I then created a python file.
5.After creating and naming the python file, I then checked the version of python 3 that is installed in my device 
before declaring it to make sure that I do not have compatibility errors in the project.
6.Before coding or seeing how to structure my python function which will hold the algorithm to the solution , I have to connect to the 
SQLite database.To connect to it I have to import the SQLite version and then create the cursor which will execute the sqlite commands.
